** Wireframe3D - 3D Wireframe Graphics Representation

Welcome to Wireframe3D, a project that transforms elevation data into a captivating 3D wireframe representation. Wireframe3D allows you to visualize landscapes in three dimensions, creating a stunning graphical depiction of heightmaps.

** Project Overview **

- What does Wireframe3D do?
    - Wireframe3D takes a map as input, where each point represents a pixel with an associated height value. It then generates a 3D wireframe using this elevation data, providing a visually engaging representation of the terrain. This project beautifully fuses mathematics and graphics programming, offering an immersive experience in the world of 3D graphics.

- Key Features
    - Interactive 3D Rendering: Wireframe3D renders an interactive 3D wireframe, allowing users to navigate through the landscape using mouse and keyboard controls.
    - Customizable Color Palette: Users can customize the color palette to add a personal touch to the graphical representation.
    - Map Projection: The project supports different map projections, providing flexibility in visualizing terrains from various perspectives.

** How to Compile Wireframe3D **

To compile the Wireframe3D program, follow these straightforward steps:

  - Clone the Repository:
      - `git clone git@github.com:Bgarnn/C-Wireframe3D.git`
      - `cd C-Wireframe3D/project`
  - Compile the Program:
      - `make`: This will generate the `wireframe3d` executable.
  - Clean the Build:
      - `make clean`: This removes the object files, leaving only the compiled program.

** Now you can use Wireframe3D to create captivating 3D wireframe representations! **

** Usage Example **

`./fdf test_maps/10-2.fdf`


(This will display the 3D wireframe representation of the provided map.)
